# hello-world..

as of the time i am writing this i am 20 years old. i don't know how i manage to get so far.
without ... yeah.

now im at a stage. where. i need to work. 

i dont hate it.

i dont really care about anything.

i like coding lol. its fun to distract my mind.

distraction is really to live in this life. 

without being distracted. doing nothing is just... something i cant keep up.

well.... let it begin.

May Allah Guide us and Bring us Ease.
